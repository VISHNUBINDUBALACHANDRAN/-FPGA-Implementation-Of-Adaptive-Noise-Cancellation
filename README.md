*(Developed during 2015–2017)*

**Note:** This project was developed during the 2015–2017 period and is no longer actively maintained or supported. It may not be fully compatible with current tools or platforms, so please use it at your own discretion.

## Overview  
This repository presents a sophisticated, FPGA-based adaptive noise cancellation framework designed to improve speech intelligibility in mobile communication environments. Implemented on a Xilinx Spartan-3E FPGA and coded in VHDL, this project demonstrates how advanced, hardware-accelerated algorithms can dramatically enhance voice quality under challenging, noise-ridden conditions.

**Key objectives:**  
- Address the unpredictable and non-stationary nature of speech and background noise.  
- Optimize speech signal clarity and intelligibility without introducing significant distortion.  
- Leverage hardware acceleration for low-latency, real-time processing.

## Core Features  
- **Adaptive Noise Filtering:**  
  Employs adaptive algorithms that dynamically adjust filter parameters in response to fluctuating noise characteristics, ensuring consistently high-quality audio output.

- **FPGA-Accelerated Processing:**  
  Exploits the parallelism and deterministic timing of FPGA logic to achieve rapid signal processing, surpassing traditional software-only solutions in both speed and reliability.

- **VHDL and RTL-Level Design:**  
  Implements advanced noise cancellation strategies at the register-transfer level (RTL), providing precise control over signal paths, resource usage, and system timing.

- **Optimized for Mobile Communication:**  
  Tailored to meet the constraints and demands of mobile environments, ensuring efficient power usage, reduced latency, and robust operation in resource-limited scenarios.

## Significance and Impact  
The project’s methodologies and results stand as a testament to the feasibility and benefits of hardware-based speech enhancement. By filtering out distracting noise while preserving the speaker’s natural vocal characteristics, it raises the standard for intelligibility in voice-driven interfaces, handset communication, and other embedded audio applications.

Conducted during the 2015–2017 period, this work established foundational principles that can guide future research and development in FPGA-based noise reduction, adaptive filtering, and advanced digital signal processing techniques for voice communication.
